Telemetry Viewer
======================

This is a small Kivy based Android app that can be used to view and graph Tlogs from Ardupilot Mega based drones.

Currently just a proof of concept,the app allows the user to view a log as text and export the infomation as a ext file. Planned features include interactive graphing and export to KML.
