Telemetry Viewer
======================

This is a small Kivy based Android app that can be used to view and graph Tlogs from Ardupilot Mega based drones.

Currently just a proof of concept,the app allows the user to view and save a log as text and to export the log to a KML file viewable in Google Earth. Planned features include interactive graphing and export to KML.
