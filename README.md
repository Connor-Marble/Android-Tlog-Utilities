Telemetry Viewer
======================

This is a small Kivy based Android app that can be used to view and graph Tlogs from Ardupilot Mega based drones.

Currently just a proof of concept,the app provides only basic reading and graphing functionality,but the plan is to produce an app that will allow telemetry logs from ardupilot megas to be reviewed and analyzed on an android tablet.
